See it live at [http://bttfclock.com/](http://bttfclock.com/).

Description
-----------

BTTFClock started as a challenge between tutor and student:

> Can you create a web-based version of the time-clock from Marty McFly's DeLorean in Back To The Future - it has to show the real time wherever it is viewed."

The clock can be seen at [http://bttfclock.com/](http://bttfclock.com/) and the code can be found, improved, learned from, enjoyed (?) at [http://github.com/rsolomou/bttfclock](http://github.com/rsolomou/bttfclock).
