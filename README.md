Description
-----------

BTTFClock started as a challenge between tutor and student:

> Can you create a web-based version of the time-clock from Marty McFly's DeLorean in Back To The Future - it has to show the real time wherever it is viewed."

The clock can be seen at [http://richardsolomou.com/bttfclock/](http://richardsolomou.com/bttfclock/), and the code can be found, improved, learned from, and enjoyed, from this repository.
